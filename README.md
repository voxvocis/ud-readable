# Readable Project

This is my implementation of the Readable project that's part of the Udacity's React Nanodegree Program.
The Readable project is a content and comment web app where users can post content to predefined categories, comment on their posts and other users' posts, and vote on posts and comments. Users are also be able to edit and delete posts and comments.


## Install and launch

* Install and start the API server
    - `cd api-server`
    - Install dependencies `npm install`
    - Start the server `node server`
* Install and start the front-end
    - `cd frontend`
    - Install dependencies `npm install`
    - Start the application `npm start`

You can now access and use the application at: http://localhost:3000/.
